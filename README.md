# zeddot
### About
Zeddot is a programming language that was made with python, to expand my basic skills of programming, and so I could even have the most skill in a language, because I made it.

### Note
For whoever uses Zeddot, thanks for supporting the project, and I will have a documentary soon, because I have not finished the programming language yet.
I hope Zeddot can help someone learn anything in programming because I know I will have a simplified syntax of a bunch of languages combined.
I will also have a few examples and a trailer on my youtube channel, which I will not link until I finish Zeddot.
Obviously, Zeddot may not get updated due to it being a small little project to help me learn programming, but if I do update, I'll make sure that it actually does
change something, and isn't a just "Bug Fix." I will also have announcements on when I update the language, if I do. Anyways, thanks for spending your time reading this, and maybe try zeddot!
